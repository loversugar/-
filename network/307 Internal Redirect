when my FE proejct accessed BE, it happend at 307 Internal Redirect with Non-Authoritative-Reason: HSTS
So I search HSTS using google, If you need to know the information in detail. please click this link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34108241/non-authoritative-reason-header-field-http.
And now we need to know why to happend it?

The server that you are trying to connect with uses strict-transport-secure(HSTS) to promise that using https access the website 
rather than HTTP. In other words, you must access this server using https, like that chrome change http://domain to https://domain.
We know using https is more safety than http.
