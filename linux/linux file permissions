Linux is strict to that control the file permissions, so if different users want to excute one file, they must have the 
corresponding permissions.
There are three file permissions on linux that respectively is r(read), w(write), and x(execute).
The granularity of permissions under Linux has owners, groups, and other groups.
And we use chmod command to modify file permission.

so let's begin to learn it.

Usage: chmod [OPTION]... MODE[,MODE]... FILE...
  or:  chmod [OPTION]... OCTAL-MODE FILE...
  or:  chmod [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...
Change the mode of each FILE to MODE.
With --reference, change the mode of each FILE to that of RFILE.

  -c, --changes          like verbose but report only when a change is made
  -f, --silent, --quiet  suppress most error messages
  -v, --verbose          output a diagnostic for every file processed
      --no-preserve-root  do not treat '/' specially (the default)
      --preserve-root    fail to operate recursively on '/'
      --reference=RFILE  use RFILE's mode instead of MODE values
  -R, --recursive        change files and directories recursively
      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit


-rw------- (600)      just owner has r and w。
-rw-r--r-- (644)      just owner has r and w； group and other have r。
-rwx------ (700)      just owner have r, w and x。
-rwxr-xr-x (755)      just owner have r, w and x；group have x and r, but other have x。
-rwx--x--x (711)      just owner have r, w and x；but group and other have x
-rw-rw-rw- (666)      all user have r and w
-rwxrwxrwx (777)      all users have rwx

we use chown command to modify file owner

Usage: chown [OPTION]... [OWNER][:[GROUP]] FILE...
  or:  chown [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...
Change the owner and/or group of each FILE to OWNER and/or GROUP.
With --reference, change the owner and group of each FILE to those of RFILE.

  -c, --changes          like verbose but report only when a change is made
  -f, --silent, --quiet  suppress most error messages
  -v, --verbose          output a diagnostic for every file processed
      --dereference      affect the referent of each symbolic link (this is
                         the default), rather than the symbolic link itself
  -h, --no-dereference   affect symbolic links instead of any referenced file
                         (useful only on systems that can change the
                         ownership of a symlink)
      --from=CURRENT_OWNER:CURRENT_GROUP
                         change the owner and/or group of each file only if
                         its current owner and/or group match those specified
                         here.  Either may be omitted, in which case a match
                         is not required for the omitted attribute
      --no-preserve-root  do not treat '/' specially (the default)
      --preserve-root    fail to operate recursively on '/'
      --reference=RFILE  use RFILE's owner and group rather than
                         specifying OWNER:GROUP values
  -R, --recursive        operate on files and directories recursively

The following options modify how a hierarchy is traversed when the -R
option is also specified.  If more than one is specified, only the final
one takes effect.

  -H                     if a command line argument is a symbolic link
                         to a directory, traverse it
  -L                     traverse every symbolic link to a directory
                         encountered
  -P                     do not traverse any symbolic links (default)

      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit

Owner is unchanged if missing.  Group is unchanged if missing, but changed
to login group if implied by a ':' following a symbolic OWNER.
OWNER and GROUP may be numeric as well as symbolic.

Examples:
  chown root /u        Change the owner of /u to "root".
  chown root:staff /u  Likewise, but also change its group to "staff".
  chown -hR root /u    Change the owner of /u and subfiles to "root".
